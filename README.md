Investigating a Dataset from The Movie Database 

I worked on the data set that contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue just to mention a few.The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

I also evaluated the effect of movie popularity against revenue and if the cast or movie director also influence movie polularity. I also will be exploring the budget of the movie and the revenues, comparing factors that affects revenue either positively or negatively.

Evaluated relationship between the genres using count and determine the genre with highest count. which genre brings more revenue, is popularity also a factor to consider here? Those are some of the question and more that will be explored from the data set.
